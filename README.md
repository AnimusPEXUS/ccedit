# About ccedit

As I don't like M$ Code, I preferred to write my own code editor as I see it fit.

## Features

* Simultenious multiproject
* Multiwindow: for multimonitor systems it's better
* Separate window with listing of open files (Work Subjects) and open editors
* Some small file explorer, enough for creating new dirs and files
* File/Text search

## what's absent and currently not planned

* outline
* syntax highlighting

## what's planned

* better unicode support via ccutils
* using own regexp engine from ccutils

## Screenshot

*  On two monitors
*  One Project open
*  Two files open
*  One editor visible
*  Using Gnome 47 window tilling capabilities
